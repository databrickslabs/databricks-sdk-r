#' The Libraries API allows you to install and uninstall libraries and get the
#' status of libraries on a cluster.
#' 
#' To make third-party or custom code available to notebooks and jobs running on
#' your clusters, you can install a library. Libraries can be written in Python,
#' Java, Scala, and R. You can upload Java, Scala, and Python libraries and
#' point to external packages in PyPI, Maven, and CRAN repositories.
#' 
#' Cluster libraries can be used by all notebooks running on a cluster. You can
#' install a cluster library directly from a public repository such as PyPI or
#' Maven, using a previously installed workspace library, or using an init
#' script.
#' 
#' When you install a library on a cluster, a notebook already attached to that
#' cluster will not immediately see the new library. You must first detach and
#' then reattach the notebook to the cluster.
#' 
#' When you uninstall a library from a cluster, the library is removed only when
#' you restart the cluster. Until you restart the cluster, the status of the
#' uninstalled library appears as Uninstall pending restart.

#' Get status.
#' 
#' Get the status of libraries on a cluster. A status will be available for all
#' libraries installed on this cluster via the API or the libraries UI as well
#' as libraries set to be installed on all clusters via the libraries UI. The
#' order of returned libraries will be as follows.
#' 
#' 1. Libraries set to be installed on this cluster will be returned first.
#' Within this group, the final order will be order in which the libraries were
#' added to the cluster.
#' 
#' 2. Libraries set to be installed on all clusters are returned next. Within
#' this group there is no order guarantee.
#' 
#' 3. Libraries that were previously requested on this cluster or on all
#' clusters, but now marked for removal. Within this group there is no order
#' guarantee.
#'
