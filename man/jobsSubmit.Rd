\description{
This is a long-running operation, which blocks until Jobs on Databricks reach
TERMINATED or SKIPPED state with the timeout of 20 minutes, that you can change via \code{timeout} parameter.
By default, the state of Databricks Jobs is reported to console. You can change this behavior
by changing the \code{callback} parameter.
}
\details{
Submit a one-time run. This endpoint allows you to submit a workload directly
without creating a job. Runs submitted using this endpoint donâ€™t display in
the UI. Use the \code{jobs/runs/get} API to check the run state after the job is
submitted.
