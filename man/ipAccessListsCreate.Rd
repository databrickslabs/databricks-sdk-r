\description{
Creates an IP access list for this workspace.
}
\details{
A list can be an allow list or a block list. See the top of this file for a
description of how the server treats allow lists and block lists at runtime.

When creating or updating an IP access list:
\itemize{
\item For all allow lists and block lists combined, the API supports a maximum of
1000 IP/CIDR values, where one CIDR counts as a single value. Attempts to
exceed that number return error 400 with \code{error_code} value \code{QUOTA_EXCEEDED}.
\item If the new list would block the calling user's current IP, error 400 is
returned with \code{error_code} value \code{INVALID_STATE}.
}

It can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect. \strong{Note}: Your new
IP access list has no effect until you enable the feature. See
:method:workspaceconf/setStatus
}
