\title{Delete the restrict workspace admins setting.}
\usage{
restrictWorkspaceAdminsDelete(client, etag = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{client}{Required. Instance of DatabricksClient()}

\item{etag}{etag used for versioning.}
}
\description{
Reverts the restrict workspace admins setting status for the workspace. A
fresh etag needs to be provided in \code{DELETE} requests (as a query parameter).
The etag can be retrieved by making a \code{GET} request before the DELETE
request. If the setting is updated/deleted concurrently, \code{DELETE} fails with
409 and the request must be retried by using the fresh etag in the 409
response.
