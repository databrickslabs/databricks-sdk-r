\description{
Gets an array of all volumes for the current metastore under the parent
catalog and schema.
}
\details{
The returned volumes are filtered based on the privileges of the calling
user. For example, the metastore admin is able to list all the volumes. A
regular user needs to be the owner or have the \strong{READ VOLUME} privilege on
the volume to recieve the volumes in the response. For the latter case, the
caller must also be the owner or have the \strong{USE_CATALOG} privilege on the
parent catalog and the \strong{USE_SCHEMA} privilege on the parent schema.

There is no guarantee of a specific ordering of the elements in the array.
