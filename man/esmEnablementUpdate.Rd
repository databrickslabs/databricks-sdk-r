\description{
Updates the enhanced security monitoring setting for the workspace. A fresh
etag needs to be provided in \code{PATCH} requests (as part of the setting field).
The etag can be retrieved by making a \code{GET} request before the \code{PATCH}
request. If the setting is updated concurrently, \code{PATCH} fails with 409 and
the request must be retried by using the fresh etag in the 409 response.
